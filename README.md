# SpellCalc

A WoW classic addon providing information for spells, like actual damage done, crit and hit chance, scaling etc.

Versions starting with 0.10 are for TBC only.

## Current Features

* Scaling with bonus damage/healing.
* Crit and hit chance.
* Average damage resisted or additional miss chance for binary spells.
* DPS and HPS values after the above.
* DPM, HPM, and done until OOM values after factoring in current mana regen.
* Can show values on the action bar.
* Options menu to change tooltip and actionbar values and some calculation settings (`/sc`)

## Things that aren't working and probably won't in the near future

* Warrior, Hunter and Rogue have no support at all.
* Paladin seals are included, but the values are off for SoB and SoV. Also
* Melee math (used for auto attacks and paladin seals) probably has problems.
