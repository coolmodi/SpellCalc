# SpellCalc

A WoW Classic SoD/Wrath addon that shows information for spells, like actual damage done, crit and hit chance, scaling etc.

This is NOT a combat simulation tool. Calculated values are for the current stats and buffs of your character and target. Not all effects in the game are implemented, numbers won't be correct in all situations. This is only meant to give you more insight than the default tooltips.

## Current Features

* Scaling with spell and attack power.
* Crit and hit chance.
* Includes most buffs and debuffs in calculations.
* Average damage resisted or additional miss chance for binary spells.
* DPS and HPS values after the above.
* DPM/HPM and done until OOM after factoring in current mana regen and some mana procs.
* Can show values on the action bar.
* Options menu to change tooltip and actionbar values and some calculation settings (`/sc`)

## Things that aren't working and probably won't in the near future

* Warrior, Hunter, DK and Rogue have no support at all for now.
